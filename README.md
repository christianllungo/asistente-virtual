# Asistente Virtual

This is a React-based virtual assistant that uses the OpenAI API to provide a customized chat interface for a small Christian group. The assistant can answer questions related to the group, provide information about upcoming events, and offer advice and encouragement based on Christian principles. The app is located at https://zingy-tanuki-8b1fa8.netlify.app/ 

## Features
- Uses the OpenAI API to generate natural language responses to user input.
- Provides information about the Christian group, including its objectives, and upcoming events.
- Offers advice and encouragement based on Christian principles and values.

## Usage

To use the virtual assistant, simply visit the deployed site or run the app locally on your machine. The app requires a connection to the OpenAI API to function properly, so you'll need to have an API key from OpenAI in order to use the chat functionality.

Once you've entered your API key, you can begin chatting with the virtual assistant by typing your questions or comments into the chat interface. The assistant will generate a natural language response based on the input and provide additional information or advice as needed.

## Installation
To install the virtual assistant on your machine, simply clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. You'll also need to create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key, like so:
```
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
Once you've set up the API key, you can run `npm start` to start the development server and view the app in your browser.
